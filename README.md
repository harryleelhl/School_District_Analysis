# Challenge

**Goal**
*Comparing two analysis results after removing the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School, make cohesive conclusions in Jupyter Notebook.

## Conclusion

After removing the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School, it affacts summary tables by slightly reducing the average scores and enomous decreasing for the passing percentage rate, including both math and reading passing percentage as well as overall passing percentage.

### Tables

There are 20 Analysis tables are in the picture folder. Attached are two examples. 

1. The *Thomas_9th_info* is information about descriptive statistic before removing the ninth-grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School.
